Run `npm start` to start the project

#things to do:
- add tests
- fix wonky input fields
- style and ui for SchoolTable and SchoolDetailsModal could use a lot of work
- SchoolDetailsModal website link isn't working as intended (prepends localhost to url)
- add filter and sort for table columns
- globalFilter for table should filter all data for the entire table to display, not just data in the table itself
